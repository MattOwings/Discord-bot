A bot that runs on the social platform "Discord" that performs a large variety of tasks such as organizing members, automatically deleting messages that are vulgar, can reply to messages, and more!

This project uses:

- JavaScript
- The Node.js library "Discord.js" (to access and use the Discord API)
- Programming techniques that value time and efficiency.

Future Plans:
- Using a Database to store information about members in my server
- Using a Database to assign levels and other 'rewards' to members in my server. 
- More text commands
