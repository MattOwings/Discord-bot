A bot that runs on the social platform "Discord" that performs a large variety of tasks such as organizing members, automatically deleting messages that are vulgar, can reply to messages, and more!

This project uses:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Programming techniques that value time and efficiency.

Future Plans:
- Using a Database to store information about members in my server
- Using a Database to assign levels and other 'rewards' to members in my server. 
- More text commands

NOTES:
- Some files are Git Ignored such as the NPM folders and files that contain sensitive data. For example, there is a 'password.js' file to login to the bot, but for obvious reasons is hidden so people cannot login to my bot.
