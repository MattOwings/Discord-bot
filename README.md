A bot that runs on the social platform "Discord" that performs a large variety of tasks such as organizing members, automatically deleting messages that are vulgar, can reply to messages, and more!

This project uses:

- JavaScript
- The Node.js library "Discord.js" (to access and use the Discord API)
- Programming techniques that value time and efficiency.

Future Plans:
- Using a Database to store information about members in my server
- Using a Database to assign levels and other 'rewards' to members in my server. 
- More text commands

NOTES:
- I export a file called 'banned_words.js" that is not in this repository. The file contains an array that contains words that are automatically deleted if someone posts in any channel in any server the bot is in. Due to the nature of this, I elected to not include this file in this repository due to it simply being a collection of these nasty words. It is very important to keep your server clean and without filthy words, and that sums up the missing file.
- There are several other files, such as the Package files and the Module files from the Node.js Library import, but this repository is simple a collection of the code I've personally done and this repository does not include files that automatically come with the installation of the Node.js "Discord.js" library.
