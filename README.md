A bot that runs on the social platform "Discord" that performs a large variety of tasks such as organizing members, automatically deleting messages that are vulgar, can reply to messages, and more!

This project uses:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Programming techniques that value time and efficiency.

Future Plans:
- Using a Database to store information about members in my server
- Using a Database to assign levels and other 'rewards' to members in my server. 
- More text commands

NOTES:
- I export a file called 'banned_words.js" that is not in this repository. The bot has a feature that can automatically delete messages, and if a random person posts a message the bot reads as 'vulgar' the message will be automatically deleted. banned_words.js is a collection of words that catch the filter and is not included due to it being a collection of such words. 
- NPM "Package" and "Node_modules" files are git ignored.
